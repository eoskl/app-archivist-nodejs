### Develop

Needs to be Added

## Getting started

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

## Developer Guide

Developers should conform to git flow workflow. Additionally, we should try to make sure
every commit builds. Commit messages should be meaningful serve as a meta history for the
repository. Please squash meaningless commits before submitting a pull-request.

There is git hook on commits to validate the project builds. If you'd like to commit your changes
while developing locally and want to skip this step you can use the `--no-verify` commit option.

i.e.

```sh
  git commit --no-verify -m "COMMIT MSG"
```
